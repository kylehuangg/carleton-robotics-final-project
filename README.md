# carleton-robotics-final-project 
# Pybricks is a software developed by the likes of an individual group independent of the LEGO company.. This software is meant to be programmed into LEGO robots that can be directed to achieve a multitude of tasks, whether it be playing music, collecting trash, or, in this scenario, simulating possible scenarios that have the potential to save human lives. The construction and execution of this robot is meant to simulate the tasks of a police robot, in which these robots traverse dangerous areas that human life cannot without serious implications. This robot is meant to use a vast amount of its resources to its advantage, and deliver useful information to the user. Furthermore, the user has the ability to construct the robot to conduct its tasks in a manual manner or an autonomous manner (“cruise control”).
